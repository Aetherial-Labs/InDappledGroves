	- Removed the following processes in favor of updated method.
			- groundChopTime - How long a tool takes to chop wood on the ground
			- groundChopDamage - The amount of durability the tool takes when chopping on the ground
			- choppingBlockChopTime - How long a tool takes to chop wood on the chopping block
			- choppingBlockChopDamage - How much damage the tool takes when chopping on the ground
	- Altered config file to provide options for changing the processing speed of wood on workstations.
			- workstationMiningSpdMult -> Modifies impact of mining speed of tools. Higher numbers = faster processing
			- workstationResistanceMult -> Modifies effective resistance of blocks on workstations. Higher numbers => slower processing.
			- groundRecipeMiningSpdMult -> Modifies impact of mining speed of tools. Higher numbers = faster processing
			- groundRecipeResistanceMult -> Modifies effective resistance of blocks on groundRecipes. Higher numbers => slower processing.
			- treefellingResistanceMult -> Higher numbers make chopping trees take longer, lower numbers increase speed of trees being choppped.
